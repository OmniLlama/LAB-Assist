## NOTE FOR JEFF

I had do do some significant changes with the Axis reading in order to get this to work. If anything you're doing is reliant on the current Axis information from the old version, let me know.

# LABAssistNG

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.6.

## NOTE: If files missing / unable to build

run npm update
***NOTE TO GRADER***
You need to run the above, and once all dependencies are installed, you will find a file called index.d.ts_BACKUP, open and copy all of its contents.
-then, you must navigate to /node_modules/heartbeat-sequencer/build/ and find the index.d.ts file within. open that and replace all of its contents with the ones copied from the root directory file. save the file, and all compiler errors should be resolved and the project will run as intended, barring any fundamental errors that obviously break intended behavior, which I can be contacted regarding further solutions to get it running.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
