# LABAssistNG

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.6.

## NOTE: If files missing / unable to build + NOTE TO GRADER

run npm update

***NOTE TO GRADER***
You need to run the above, and once all dependencies are installed, you will find a file called index.d.ts_BACKUP in the root directory, open and copy all of its contents.
-then, you must navigate to /node_modules/heartbeat-sequencer/build/ and find the index.d.ts file within. open that and replace all of its contents with the ones copied from the root directory file. save the file, and all compiler errors should be resolved and the project will run as intended, barring any fundamental errors that obviously break intended behavior, which I can be contacted regarding further solutions to get it running.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
